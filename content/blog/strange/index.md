When it comes to raw power in the MCU, no hero comes close to Doctor Stephen Strange. Here's why the Master of the Mystic Arts stands above the rest.

## The Time Stone Mastery

While other Avengers rely on physical strength or technology, Doctor Strange showed unprecedented mastery over the Time Stone, something even Thanos respected. His abilities include:

- Time manipulation
- Creating time loops
- Seeing millions of possible futures
- Reversing catastrophic events

## Mastery of the Mystic Arts

Strange's magical abilities include:

1. Portal creation across vast distances
2. Astral projection
3. Mirror dimension manipulation
4. Reality warping
5. Protective spells and shields

## Beyond Physical Limitations

Unlike heroes who depend on:
- Physical strength (Hulk)
- Technology (Iron Man)
- Specific weapons (Thor)

Strange's powers are limited only by his knowledge and imagination.

## Notable Feats

- Held his own against Thanos with multiple infinity stones
- Protected Earth from interdimensional threats
- Contained an Infinity Stone in a time loop
- Mastered the mystic arts in record time

## The Strategic Mind

What truly sets Strange apart is his combination of:
- Photographic memory
- Medical expertise
- Tactical genius
- Mystical knowledge

```
"We're in the endgame now."
```
